by @MarkChaitra

Description:\
Asteroid Dodge is an arcade-style survival game built using Python’s turtle graphics library.\
You control a rocket ship and must dodge falling asteroids for as long as possible to earn points.\
Each asteroid you successfully avoid increases your score — but a single collision resets the game!

How to Play:\
Move your rocket ship left and right to avoid incoming asteroids.\
Asteroids fall randomly from the top of the screen.\
For every asteroid that passes safely, you earn +1 point.\
If you collide with an asteroid, your score resets, but your high score remains.

Game Features:\
Smooth player movement with key press and release control.\
Random asteroid generation and continuous falling motion.\
Real-time score tracking with a persistent high score display.\
Automatic reset after collision.\
