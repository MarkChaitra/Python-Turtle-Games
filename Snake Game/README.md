🐍 Overview\
Snake is a classic arcade-style game recreated in Python using the turtle graphics library.\
Your goal: guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and score as many points as possible without hitting the walls or yourself!

🎮 Gameplay\
Control a black snake that moves continuously across the screen.\
Red food appears randomly — eat it to grow longer and increase your score.\
The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.\
The high score updates whenever you beat your previous record.

🕹️ Controls\
Key	Action\
W	Move Up\

S	Move Down\
D	Move Right

💥 Rules
You gain +10 points for every food eaten.\
If you collide with the wall or your own body, your score resets to 0.\
The high score remains for the session.\
The snake moves faster as it grows longer (since delay stays constant).
